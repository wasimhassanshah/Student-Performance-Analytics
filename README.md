# Student-Performance-Analytics
Analyzed impact of multiple variables on student performance (test scores) using data analysis techniques (descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis, classification, clustering) to identify key influencers and trends (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels)

# Introduction
Education is an important element of the society, every government and country in the world work so hard to improve this sector. With the corona-virus outbreak that has disrupted life around the globe in 2020, the educational systems have been affected in many ways; studies show that studentâ€™s performance has decreased since then, which highlights the need to deal with this problem more seriously and try to find effective solutions, as well as the influencing factors.

# Motivation
The educational systems need, at this specific time, innovative ways to improve quality of education to achieve the best results and decrease the failure rate.

As students of the IT department who studied in the last month a little about machine learning, we know that in order for an institute to provide quality education to learners, deep analysis of previous records of the learners can play a vital role, and wanted to work on this challenging task.

# Results
The analysis revealed several interesting insights about student performance. For example, I have analysed that the number of females are more than the number of male in the data. I have concluded that the education of parents have a good impact on the scores of thrie childrens. I have analysed that the Marital Status of the parents have a very negligible impact on their children. I have gained an insight of the distribuation of Ethenic groups and the number of students from different Ethenic Group. Students who have standard lunch type tend to have higher math scores than those who have free/reduced lunch type. The regression analysis showed that the lunch type, weekly study hours, and whether the student is the first child in their family are significant predictors of math score.
